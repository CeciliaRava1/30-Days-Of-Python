### variables ###

"""Python Variable Name Rules
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)
- snake_case
"""

3. Compare the length of your first name and your last name
4. Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
5. Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
6. Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
7. Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
8. Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
9. Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
10. Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
11. Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
