### higher order functions ###

countries = ['Estonia', 'Finland', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Iceland']
names = ['Asabeneh', 'Lidiya', 'Ermias', 'Abraham']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Exercises: Level 1
Explain the difference between map, filter, and reduce.
    - Map: Transform items in an iterable
    - Filter: Filter items in an iterable with a condition
    - Reduce: Applies a function to the items of a iterable

Explain the difference between higher order function, closure and decorator
    - Higher order function: Takes a function as an argument or returns a function
    - Closure: Function that has access to its own scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope
    - Decorator: Type of higher order function used to modify or extend the behavior of another function without changing its 
    original code

Define a call function before map, filter or reduce, see examples.
Use for loop to print each country in the countries list.
'''

def sum_one(number):
    return number + 1
numbers_sum = map(sum_one, numbers)
# print(list(numbers_sum))


# for country in countries:
#     print(country)

'''

Exercises: Level 2
Use map to create a new list by changing each country to uppercase in the countries list
Use map to create a new list by changing each number to its square in the numbers list
Use map to change each name to uppercase in the names list
Use filter to filter out countries containing 'land'.
Use filter to filter out countries having exactly six characters.
Use filter to filter out countries containing six letters and more in the country list.
Use filter to filter out countries starting with an 'E'
Chain two or more list iterators (eg. arr.map(callback).filter(callback).reduce(callback))

Declare a function called get_string_lists which takes a list as a parameter and then returns a list containing only string items.
Use reduce to sum all the numbers in the numbers list.
Use reduce to concatenate all the countries and to produce this sentence: Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland are north European countries
Declare a function called categorize_countries that returns a list of countries with some common pattern (you can find the countries list in this repository as countries.js(eg 'land', 'ia', 'island', 'stan')).
Create a function returning a dictionary, where keys stand for starting letters of countries and values are the number of country names starting with that letter.
Declare a get_first_ten_countries function - it returns a list of first ten countries from the countries.js list in the data folder.
Declare a get_last_ten_countries function that returns the last ten countries in the countries list.
